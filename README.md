# Wind-Speed-Prediction-using-Deep-Learning-Methods

In this notebook, I builds a few different deep learning models including Convolutional and Recurrent Neural Networks (CNNs and RNNs). 
Unlike other machine learning algorithms, long short-term memory recurrent neural networks are capable of automatically learning features from sequence data, 
support multi-variate data, and can output a variable length sequences that can be used for multi-step forecasting. 

In this study, a weather data set provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration of South Plains Region of Texas is is used which consists 
of weather data of every hour in the year 2010.

This research is presented in poster competition organized by Graduate School Texas Tech University
